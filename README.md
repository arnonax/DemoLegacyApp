# DemoLegacyApp
Legacy application for demoing test automation

This repo is more as an online backup for my local repo that I use for preparing and performing a demo(s) of automated tests.

I expect to use branches on this repo for various demos and states of the demos that I can quickly jump between, and probably not so much as it's normally used for development tasks...
